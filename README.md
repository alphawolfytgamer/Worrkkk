> [!IMPORTANT]
> An update to ChromeOS (v115/v116) released in August 2023 has blocked all javascript: and javascript:// bookmarklets. If you use a managed Chromebook and **Devtools are turned off** (that means inspect element, etc.) then the Car Axle Client Bookmarklet won't work. In this case, you should use an [about:blank Injector](https://disnos9.github.io/jsinject/), but some features won't work (history flooder, scripts, etc.).

## Features
<!-- hopefully this is a list -->
-   Exploits

Just fork and submit a pull request and I will likely add it with some minor changes.

Things you can contribute:

-   Adding small features
-   Refractoring the code

# Adding proxies
> [!TIP]
> You can either make a pull request yourself and add new proxies in src/modules/modules/scripts/proxies.ts.

Adding proxies couldnt be made simpler, all you have to do is **FOLLOW THE PATTERN!!!**
Removing old/broken proxies is greatly appreciated

> [!WARNING]
> Unverified and Direct-IP proxies will NOT be accepted for user safety.
