# Contributing
> [!NOTE]
> Contributing on v9 is not recommended until docs have been created and penex as well as the layer on top of it has been finalized. If you are building from source, you should not need to worry.

 Contributing is made to be as easy as possible.  
 Check out the wiki for a guide on how the code works!

 Just fork and submit a pull request and I will likely add it with some minor changes.

 Things you can contribute:

-   Fixing UI bugs (you can ask me for help if needed)
-   Adding small features
-   Refractoring the code
-   Adding new proxies
-   Assist with Github issues
-   Remove Old/Broken proxies
  
## Docs

The docs are currently in progress. They will be a seperate repo and will be linked here when they are ready.
